Lecture 2 Notes

Difference between printing and evaluating expressions. 
E.g. printing a string literal returns string without quotation marks but evaluating it returns string with quotes.

None - special value that indicates nothing returned
No return values = return None
None isn't usually displayed by the interpreter

Pure functions - only return values
Non-pure functions - have side effects
