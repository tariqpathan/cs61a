Expressions describes a computation and evaluates to a value
Function call notation

In call expressions you don't need to worry about the order
call expression: fn(param1, param2) 
terminology: operator(operand, operand)

Call expressions are evaluated in the same way, using evaluation procedures.

Evaluate the operator, then the operand subexpressions.
Apply the function that is the value of the operator to the arguments that are the values of the operand subexpressions

In python assignment statements, on the RHS of the assignment operator (=), the Python interpreter works out the values of expressions from left to right

variable_1, variable_2 = first_statement_evaluated, second_statement_evaluated, third_statement_evaluated 

Once the statements on the RHS have been evaluated, then the values are bound. Binding happens after statement evaluation.

----
Assignment binds names to values
Function definition binds names to *expressions*

----
All expressions are evaluated in the context of an environment.

An environment is a sequence of frames
A frame is a binding between names and values
A name evaluates to the value that binds the name in the earliest environment (when that name is mentioned)

Local frames occur earlier than the global frame
