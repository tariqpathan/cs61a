Higher-Order Functions (HOF) take in functions as arguments or return functions as values.

def repeat(f, x):
    ...
    return

def g(y):
    ...
    return

result = repeat(g, n)

Video 3: Why isn't the g function called inside the repeat frame, but instead is within the global frame?
