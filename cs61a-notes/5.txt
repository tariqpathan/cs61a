Higher-Order Functions (HOF) take in functions as arguments or return functions as values.

def repeat(f, x):
    ...
    return

def g(y):
    ...
    return

result = repeat(g, n)

Video 3: Why isn't the g function called inside the repeat frame, but instead is within the global frame?
Answer (my own): Because g was created in the global frame. The parent of a function is set to the current frame where that function is created.
In this case, g was created in the global frame, so the parent of g is the global frame.

Every user-defined function has a parent frame. With nested defs, the inner def will have the outer def as a parent.
The parent of a function is the frame in which it was defined.
Therefore, the parent of a frame is also the parent of the function called.

Lambda Expressions
Expressions that evaluate to functions - bind to a name a function that takes in some argument and returns a values

value = lambda param: return_something_with_param(s) - no return / def keyword
Lambdas are limited to single Expressions
def statements have an intrinsic name, lambda functions do not.

Check conditions for some of the questions
construct_check.py - required for test cases
remove portion of test cases that uses that file
hw2 onwards use newer version of construct_check.py
replace spring 2020 with fall 2020 version
